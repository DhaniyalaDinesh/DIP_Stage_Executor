# DIP_Stage_Executor
DIP Stage Executor is a comprehensive and modular Python project designed to demonstrate the complete workflow of Digital Image Processing (DIP). It implements all nine fundamental stages of DIP â€” from image acquisition to compression â€” in a structured and educational manner.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
DIP Stage Executor is a modular Python project that implements the **entire pipeline of Digital Image Processing (DIP)** in nine stages.  
It provides both **manual algorithm implementations** (for learning purposes) and **OpenCV-based methods** (for optimized performance).  
The project is ideal for students, educators, and researchers who want a **stage-by-stage understanding** of DIP concepts.
